Description:

This video shows the tractor driving the whole path and manual control being used.The tractor has gyrescope which is used to calculate the initial angle and force the  
tractor to drive in a straight line without throwing off to the right or left side. The tractor uses infra red sensor which detects the black tape. Whenever there is a black 
tape the tractor should makea 90 degrees turn. In this video, the tractor stops twice. This is because there is a GUI for manual control. The manual control allows the tractor 
to be started and stopped using a laptop. Thus when the tractor stops and goes again this is the GUI being used. Notice that the tractor stops before hitting the wall in the
last seconds of the video. This is because the tractor has an ultrasonic sensor which detects if there are objects infront of the tractor. Thus the tractor performs an emergency 
stop whenever there is an obstacle in the way.
