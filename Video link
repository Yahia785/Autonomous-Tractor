Description:

This video shows the tractor driving the whole path and manual control being used. The tractor uses infra red sensor which detects the black tape. Whenever there is a black tape the tractor should make
a 90 degrees turn. In this video, the tractor stops twice. This is because there is a GUI for manual control. The manual control allows the tractor to be started and stopped
using a laptop. Thus when the tractor stops and goes again this is the GUI being used.
